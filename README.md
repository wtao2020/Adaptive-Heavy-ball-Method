ICLR2021: The Role of Momentum Parameters in Acceleration of Adaptive Heavy-ball Methods

Following \citep{mukkamala2017variants}, we conduct experiments on a sever with 2 NVIDIA 2080Ti GPUs. We design a simple 4-layer CNN architecture that consists two convolutional layers (32 filters of size 3 $\times$ 3), one max-pooling layer (2 $\times$ 2 window and 0.25 dropout) and one fully connected layer (128 hidden units and 0.5 dropout). We use weight decay and batch normalization to reduce over-fitting.
